## 🛠️ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the `juanslr.github.io` repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juanslr/juanslr.github.io.git
cd juanslr.github.io
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate into each project directory (`frontend`, `backend`, `bot`) and install their respective dependencies.

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install # or yarn install
cd ..
```

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install # or yarn install
cd ..
```

#### Bot

```bash
cd bot
npm install # or yarn install
cd ..
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Some components might require environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` and/or `bot` directories based on your specific needs.

Example `.env` for backend:

```
PORT=3000
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```


## 🚀 Usage Examples

Once installed, you can run each component of the project.

### Starting the Frontend

To run the web interface, navigate to the `frontend` directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start # or yarn start
```

Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by the frontend server) to see the website.

### Starting the Backend

To run the backend services, navigate to the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
npm start # or yarn start
```

The backend will typically run on `http://localhost:3001` (or your configured `PORT`).

### Starting the Bot

To run the bot, navigate to the `bot` directory:

```bash
cd bot
npm start # or yarn start
```

The bot will start its operations as configured.
